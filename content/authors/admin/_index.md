    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of Machine learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a doctoral student at Tohoku University，My research interests include using machine learning and various time-series signal analysis methods to develop technologies that extract information indicating mental states from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and autonomic nervous system signals such as heart rate and respiration.
